# 🏆 Nobel Laureates Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing the Nobel Laureates data based on various parameters using `pandas` and `numpy`, with visualizations created using `matplotlib`, `plotly`, and `seaborn`.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of Nobel Laureates data. We explore various aspects such as the distribution of prizes across different categories and countries, the age of laureates when they won, and trends over the years. The insights are presented through detailed visualizations.

## 📁 Data

The dataset contains information about Nobel Laureates including their names, birth dates, birth countries, categories of prizes, and the years they received their prizes.

## 📈 Analysis and Visualizations

The analysis includes:

1. **🏅 Distribution of Prizes by Category and Country**:
   - Visualized using bar charts and pie charts.
2. **🎂 Age of Laureates When Winning**:
   - Analyzed using box plots.
3. **📅 Trends Over the Years**:
   - Examined through line plots and cumulative sum plots.
4. **🌆 Top Cities by Number of Nobel Prizes**:
   - Represented using bar charts.
5. **🗺️ Geographical Distribution of Nobel Prizes**:
   - Displayed through choropleth maps.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **🐼 Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **🔢 Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **📊 Matplotlib**: For static visualizations.
- **📈 Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical visualizations.
- **🌐 Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
